# Research: Streaming client library promotion

## Prompt / Issue

- Issue: #159 â€” "Feature: Promote streaming client to first-class module (library + CLI)" (milestone M2: TUI polish).
- Goal: Extract the Python streaming client logic into a reusable library and provide a thin CLI for headless / automated agents.

## Current Understanding

- `magent2/client/cli.py` contains robust SSE handling (send, stream, quiet/JSON modes). It is currently invoked via the `magent2-client` console script.
- The deprecated umbrella CLI (`magent2/cli.py`) has been removed; only the streaming client entry point remains.
- TUI and future headless tooling should share a common streaming abstraction to avoid divergence.

## Constraints / Guardrails

- Follow AGENTS.md workflow (context engineering, minimal diffs, tests).
- Preserve existing CLI behaviours (quiet/JSON, resume, tool-step context).
- Avoid breaking changes for existing scripts invoking `magent2-client`.
- Keep dependencies aligned with project policy (use `uv` for Python deps).

## References to Review

- `magent2/client/cli.py` (current implementation to refactor).
- `magent2/client/__init__.py` (exports, if any) and related tests under `tests/`.
- Issue #122 (Epic) for guidance on client UX expectations.
- Documentation references in `README.md` and `docs/FRONTEND_TUI.md`.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

- Preferred public API shape (synchronous wrapper vs async context manager?).
- How to expose conversation events for programmatic consumption (iterator, callbacks, async stream?).
- Should command options move to `argparse` subcommands (e.g., `send`, `stream`) during promotion, or stay flat for compatibility?
- What testing strategy is required (unit tests for streaming parser, integration with mocked gateway)?

## Next Steps

- Outline proposed module structure (`magent2/client/streaming.py`, CLI wrapper).
- Draft plan with milestones, acceptance criteria, and validation steps.
- Sync with maintainers on API design expectations if ambiguous.
